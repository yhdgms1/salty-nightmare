## About

That mod adds Salt Block, Salt Powder, and Salt Potion to the game.

- Salt Block behaves like sand, but unlike it, it causes damage to the player if he has less than half of his health
- Salt Powder falls out of the block when destroyed. You can create a block or in a potion maker, when mixed with a bottle of water, you can get salt water (aka Salt Potion)
- Salt water makes you thirsty

## Installation
